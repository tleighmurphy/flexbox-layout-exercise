                <p>I am a Responsive Designer & Developer who always puts customer needs first so they can easily find what they need. When I am not in front of a screen I can be found going for walks, cooking or trying out new restaurants. I also love taking trips with my husband and 2 teen sons.</p>

                <p>I was born and raised in Chicago, though I have lived in many other cities. I went to college in Boston and Madrid, worked in the food and wine industry in New York City and San Francisco, got married and started my family back in Chicago. For over a decade I have lived in Scottsdale, Arizona and have been exploring the beautiful American Southwest. </p>

                <p>My passion: I LOVE taking trips with my husband and teen sons. Exploring new places and finding sights was an interest of mine that began when I backpacked through Europe after college graduation. It is so fun to get to experience travel adventures now while taking road trips to exciting and sometimes obscure places with my family.</p>

                <p>A fun fact: As a way to make wine less intimidating to people I created and sold a wine-tasting themed board game, called Winerd. It sold nationwide globally for over a decade. I believe it was the most successful wine themed board game ever. Due to customer demand, I also created the BeerNerd game, which sold out within weeks of its market debut. </p>
